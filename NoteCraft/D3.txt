//For production we need optimization,bundle,minification,etc

Bundlers
Parcel,vite,webpack,etc

cerate react app uses webpack bundler

Package managers
npm ,yarn

npm init -y  //-y will skip options

npm install -D parcel  //parcel will be installed as devDependancy in package.json .We used this because we only want parcel at development side not at production site
  "devDependencies": {
    "parcel": "^2.9.3"  //check meaning of ^ in net
  }

^2.9.3l
greater than this version is good/okay for project
2.9.3
Only this version is good/okay for project

package-lock.json??
package.json will update parcel if update is availble so 
Initial ^2.9.3
After updation of parcel ^2.9.4
But may our project needs initial one .SO ,for that package-lock.json required
This will locks a certain version for your project
Don't insert in gitgnore ,you have to put package-lock.json at project place

code -> git -> server
code ->server   wrongest method/server will die/expload 

So git needs all this packages.DO this to avoid meme "It works on my PC but not on others"

node_modules is a database for npm 
From this all superpowers will come
don't push/share node_modules to anyone or repo.
This is because node_modules will be presnt on server and whatever packages required from node_modules are mentions in package-lock.json and package.json  >So put only this json file

NOTE
Never edit node_modules and package-lock.json

npm install react  //This shows we want react globally i.e both development and production level
npm i react-dom   //Installling react dom
npx parcel index.html  //Will ignite/create/run server with link,
npx parcel build index.html   //production level build.The all production files will be pushed at dist folder
//Errors
//Import/export error   and react-dom/client
//type = modules   i.e script types HTML
//Also remove index.js from  package.json
// i.e  "main": "App.js",
//Do this i.e removing App.js while npx parcel build index.html

Only module can do import and export

Parcel
Parcel cache:This files are used for working of loading of server
HMR - Hot Module Reload helps to update website for every change
File watcher algorithm written in C++ helps to keep terack on files in projects and loads server contimusoly using parcerl
Push parcel-cache in gitigonore  (Notsure)
What is heavy objects for website????
media like images ,videos ,gif ,etc

//HMR - Hot Module Replacement helps to update website for every change
//File watcher algorithm written in C++ helps to keep terack on files in projects and loads server contimusoly using parcerl
//Bundling
//MINIFY
//Removing console.log
//Cleaning code
//Superfast build algorithm
//Dev and production build\
//Parcel does all optimization like files,images,etc
//Caching while development i.e Parcel cache:This files are used for working of loading of server
//compressiion of files eg var number=10  =>  var n=10 (this file present in dist checak after build )
//Compatible with older browsers
//Our website is on now running on HTTp but we can run it on HTTPS in localhoast
//eg npx parcel index.html --https  (used in testing phase)
//Port numbers are also manged by parcel .They are not fixed
//Consisting hashing
//Zero config bundler
//Tree shaking - Removing un-wanted code
//
//All this above functions are present in node_modules
//Parcel acts as OS the organizer
//If modi is react then parcel(bundler) is amit shaha
//This all are done by parcel


NOTE
Anything generated automatically or generate on server will be pushed on gitigonre

Interview imp word
Transitive dependancies
eg. PM wins due to MLA  ,MLA due to local leader ,local leader due to peoples
Package manager take care of Transitive dependancies of code

What makes react webapp fast?
virtual DOM
Bundelers
npm modules
and many other tools/components help react for speedup




In short Parcel is beast
